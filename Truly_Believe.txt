Song Title: Truly Believe
Artist: Edwin McCain

I didn't reach out,
Cause I didn't need saving.
I wasn't drowning,
I was just waving.
I apologize, 
for the misunderstanding.
But I wasn't falling, 
I was just landing.
I'm not over,
Just getting started.
I'm not gonna be some,
dearly departed.
I wouldn't shatter,
to the touch.
Baby you worry,
A little too much.

[Chorus]
If you let me be,
Who I'm becoming,
Stop seeing me,
as everything I've been.
You could be free,
from the wondering.
Let me give you something to,
truly believe in.

If I'm guilty,
it's not murder,
But is killing time,
so unkind?
And we take this struggle,
further and further.
Only to find,
oh no finish lines.

[Chorus]
If you let me be,
who I am becoming.
Stop seeing me,
as everything I've been.
You could be free,
from the wondering.
Let me give you something to,
truly believe in.

We can chose to fight the war,
or find the little things.
There's music in the notes,
it's in the space between.

[Chorus]
If you let me be,
who I'm becoming.
Stop seeing me,
as everything I've been.
You could be free,
from the wondering.
Let me give you something to,
truly believe in forgiveness.
I truly believe,
we can begin again.
I truly believe,
I can fix this.
Let me give you something,
to truly believe in
