Title: Some Other Sucker's Parade
Artist: Del Amitri

I must've had a million damn unlucky days 
But there ain't no cloud that a bottle can't chase away 
And I've done my deal of living, ran from place to place 
But when the roof comes in I don't wanna take it straight 

[Chorus]
They say with faith any soul can make it 
But hell, why should I wait 
Till the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade 

I've had my share of heartaches, let-downs and tricks
But the everyday blues is the one thing I can't fix 
And I've heard those holy brethren muttering my name 
But it ain't no sin to drink when you're suffering 

[Chorus]
Patience, they say, is a saintly virtue 
But hell, why should I wait 
Till the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade 

When every heavy skyline just empties on your fate 
Sometimes keeping dry's something to celebrate 

[Chorus]
So if the road of sin is the one I'm taking 
I ain't gonna stray 
Till the clouds go rain on some other sucker's parade
